    <string name="news_content">According to Lloyd’s Register Foundation, people in countries with a high dependence on fossil fuel production for internal energy needs or exports are less likely to view climate change as a threat. It follows the latest analysis of the latest World Risk Poll, powered by Gallup, which surveyed 125,000 people across 121 countries. The Poll asked respondents whether they think climate change will be a threat to people in their country in the next 20 years. At a global level, 41% of respondents said climate change is a ‘very serious threat’, increasing to 67% when people who see it as a ‘somewhat serious threat’ are included.Lloyd’s Register Foundation also found that in all countries where energy contributes more than 50% of all exports, less than 50% of the population view climate change as a ‘very serious threat’. This includes Norway, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which is set to host the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference, COP28, later this year. This compares with numerous countries, especially in Europe and Latin America, where concern is much higher, with as many as 87% of people in the most concerned country, Chile, calling climate change a ‘very serious threat’.</string>
